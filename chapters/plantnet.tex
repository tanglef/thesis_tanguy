        \textbf{Contributions -- Exploration of Pl@ntNet label aggregation strategy}
        \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,start=4]
        \item We release the Pl@ntNet label aggregation and compare it to other large citizen platforms.
        \item We release a subset of Pl@ntNet with images url and collected labels in the South Western European Flora of more than $6$ million observations and $800$ thousand users in a large scale classification setting.
        \item We discuss on how to integrate AI based votes in active learning systems without having a snowball effect where the AI is only learning from itself.
