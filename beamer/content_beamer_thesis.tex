Many existing weight choices:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=15pt]
    \item Inter worker agreement: WAWA \footnote{\url{https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703205-Calculating-Worker-Agreement-with-Aggregate-Wawa}}:
    \[
    \mathrm{weight}(w_j) = \mathrm{Accuracy}(\{y_i^{(j)}\}_i, \{\hat {y_i}^\mathrm{MV}\}_i)
    \]
    \item Feature importance + game theory: Shapley-value weight\footfullcite{lefort:hal-04573727}
    \item Matrix completion: MACE\footfullcite{hovy2013learning} \dots
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pros:} "simple" weight can scale to large datasets and be easy to interpret

\textbf{Cons:} Can not capture worker skills in detail
