  abstract  = {In a typical citizen science/crowdsourcing environment, the contributors label items. When there are few labels, it is straightforward to train contributors and judge the quality of their labels by giving a few examples with known answers. Neither is true when there are thousands of domain-specific labels and annotators with heterogeneous skills. This demo paper presents an Active User Training framework implemented as a serious game called ThePlantGame. It is based on a set of data-driven algorithms allowing to (i) actively train annotators, and (ii) evaluate the quality of contributors' answers on new test items to optimize predictions.},

We develop a probabilistic framework to make sensible decisions about candidate links and to identify unreliable human workers. We evaluate ZenCrowd in a real deployment and show how a combination of both probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing techniques can significantly improve the quality of the links, while limiting the amount of work performed by the crowd.},

  abstract  = {Litter is a known cause of degradation in marine
               environments and most of it travels in rivers before reaching the
               oceans. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to assist waste
               monitoring along watercourses. While several attempts have been made
               to quantify litter using neural object detection in photographs of
               floating items, we tackle the more challenging task of counting
               directly in videos using boat-embedded cameras. We rely on
               multi-object tracking (MOT) but focus on the key pitfalls of false
               and redundant counts which arise in typical scenarios of poor
               detection performance. Our system only requires supervision at the
               image level and performs Bayesian filtering via a state space model
               based on optical flow. We present a new open image dataset gathered
               through a crowdsourced campaign and used to train a center-based
               anchor-free object detector. Realistic video footage assembled by
               water monitoring experts is annotated and provided for evaluation.
               Improvements in count quality are demonstrated against systems built
               from state-of-the-art multi-object trackers sharing the same
               detection capabilities. A precise error decomposition allows clear
               analysis and highlights the remaining challenges.}
